## Phase 1: Critical Performance Fixes (Week 1-2) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Priority 1: Async I/O Operations ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Target Files:**
- `server.py:800-806` - File size validation
- `utils/file_utils.py:575-596` - File reading operations
- `tools/base_tool.py:980-985` - File content preparation

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Install async file dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Add to requirements.txt
   aiofiles>=23.2.0
   ```

   **üìö Documentation Reference:** [aiofiles - Asynchronous file operations for asyncio](https://github.com/tinche/aiofiles)
   
   **Key Features:**
   - Non-blocking file I/O operations
   - Context manager support with `async with`
   - Chunked reading for memory efficiency
   - Temporary file support

2. **Refactor server.py file operations**
   ```python
   # Replace blocking file operations
   import aiofiles
   import asyncio
   
   async def check_total_file_size_async(files: list[str], model_name: str) -> dict:
       """Async version of file size checking with semaphore-based concurrency control"""
       # Use semaphore to limit concurrent file operations
       semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(10)  # Limit concurrent operations
       
       async def check_single_file(file_path: str) -> tuple[str, int]:
           async with semaphore:  # Automatically releases on exception
               try:
                   stat_result = await asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor(
                       None, os.stat, file_path
                   )
                   return file_path, stat_result.st_size
               except OSError:
                   return file_path, 0
       
       tasks = [check_single_file(f) for f in files]
       results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
       # Process results...
   ```

   **üîß Implementation Notes:**
   - **Semaphore Pattern:** Limits concurrent file operations to prevent system overload
   - **Context Manager:** `async with semaphore:` ensures automatic resource release
   - **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of file access errors
   - **Batch Processing:** `asyncio.gather()` processes all files concurrently

3. **Update file_utils.py for streaming**
   ```python
   async def read_files_async(file_paths: list[str], **kwargs) -> str:
       """Asynchronous file reading with memory management and chunked processing"""
       semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(5)  # Limit concurrent reads
       
       async def read_single_file(file_path: str) -> tuple[str, str, int]:
           async with semaphore:
               try:
                   async with aiofiles.open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                       # Stream large files in chunks for memory efficiency
                       content_chunks = []
                       while True:
                           chunk = await f.read(8192)  # 8KB chunks
                           if not chunk:
                               break
                           content_chunks.append(chunk)
                       
                       content = ''.join(content_chunks)
                       return file_path, content, len(content)
               except Exception as e:
                   return file_path, f"Error reading file: {e}", 0
   ```

   **üìñ Based on aiofiles Best Practices:**
   ```python
   # Example: Line-by-line async iteration for large files
   async def process_large_file_async(file_path: str):
       async with aiofiles.open(file_path, mode='r') as f:
           async for line in f:  # Memory-efficient line iteration
               yield process_line(line)
   
   # Example: Temporary file handling
   async def create_temp_processing_file():
       async with aiofiles.tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile('w+') as temp_file:
           await temp_file.write("Processing data...")
           await temp_file.seek(0)
           return await temp_file.read()
   ```

   **üöÄ Performance Benefits:**
   - **Non-blocking I/O:** Doesn't block the event loop during file operations

   # Tool path caching
   declare -A _tool_cache
   get_tool_path() {
       local tool="$1"
       if [[ -z "${_tool_cache[$tool]:-}" ]]; then
           if [[ -f ".zen_venv/bin/$tool" ]]; then
               _tool_cache[$tool]=".zen_venv/bin/$tool"
           else
               _tool_cache[$tool]="$tool"
           fi
       fi
       echo "${_tool_cache[$tool]}"
   }
   
   RUFF=$(get_tool_path "ruff")
   BLACK=$(get_tool_path "black")
   ISORT=$(get_tool_path "isort")
   
   # Run tools in parallel
   echo "Running ruff fix..." && $RUFF check --fix --exclude test_simulation_files &
   ruff_fix_pid=$!
   
   echo "Running black formatting..." && $BLACK . --exclude="test_simulation_files/" &
   black_pid=$!
   
   echo "Running isort..." && $ISORT . --skip-glob=".zen_venv/*" --skip-glob="test_simulation_files/*" &

       exit 1
   fi
   
   # Final verification
   echo "Running final ruff check..."
   $RUFF check --exclude test_simulation_files

### Priority 3: Connection Pooling Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Target Files:** All providers except `dial.py`

**Implementation Strategy:**

1. **Create base connection pool mixin**
   ```python
   # File: providers/connection_mixin.py
   import httpx
   from typing import Optional
   
   class ConnectionPoolMixin:
       """Mixin for providers requiring HTTP connection pooling"""
       
       _shared_clients: dict[str, httpx.Client] = {}
       
       def get_http_client(self, base_url: str, timeout: float = 30.0) -> httpx.Client:
           """Get or create shared HTTP client with connection pooling"""
           client_key = f"{base_url}_{timeout}"
           
           if client_key not in self._shared_clients:
               self._shared_clients[client_key] = httpx.Client(
                   base_url=base_url,
                   timeout=httpx.Timeout(timeout),
                   limits=httpx.Limits(
                       max_keepalive_connections=10,
                       max_connections=20,
                       keepalive_expiry=300.0
                   ),
                   follow_redirects=True
               )
           
           return self._shared_clients[client_key]
       
       @classmethod
       def cleanup_connections(cls):
           """Clean up all shared connections"""
           for client in cls._shared_clients.values():
               client.close()
           cls._shared_clients.clear()
   ```

   **üìö HTTPX Connection Pooling Documentation:**
   
   **Best Practices from HTTPX:**
   ```python
   # Context manager pattern for proper resource management
   async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
       response = await client.get('https://www.example.com/')
   
   # Explicit connection pool configuration
   limits = httpx.Limits(
       max_keepalive_connections=5,  # Reusable connections
       max_connections=10,           # Total connection limit
       keepalive_expiry=300.0        # Connection lifetime (5 minutes)
   )
   client = httpx.Client(limits=limits)
   
   # Fine-tuned timeout configuration
   timeout = httpx.Timeout(
       connect=5.0,    # Connection establishment timeout
       read=10.0,      # Response read timeout  
       write=5.0,      # Request write timeout
       pool=2.0        # Connection pool timeout
   )
   ```

   **üîß Advanced Connection Pool Features:**
   - **Keep-alive Management:** Reuses TCP connections for better performance

       def __init__(self, api_key: str, base_url: str, ...):
           super().__init__()
           self.api_key = api_key
           self.base_url = base_url
           # Remove individual client creation
           # Use shared client from mixin
       
       def _get_client(self) -> httpx.Client:
           """Get connection-pooled HTTP client"""
           return self.get_http_client(self.base_url, self.timeout)

    shared_resource.update()
```

### Performance Optimization Patterns

#### üîí **Semaphore-Based Connection Pooling**
Based on asyncio best practices for managing concurrent connections:

```python
class ConnectionPool:
    def __init__(self, max_connections: int):
        self.semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(max_connections)
        self.connections = asyncio.Queue(maxsize=max_connections)
    
    async def acquire(self):
        async with self.semaphore:
            try:
                connection = self.connections.get_nowait()
            except asyncio.QueueEmpty:
                connection = await self.create_connection()
            return connection
    
    async def release(self, connection):
        try:
            self.connections.put_nowait(connection)
        except asyncio.QueueFull:
            await self.close_connection(connection)
```

#### üö¶ **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
For resilient service communication:

```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, timeout=60):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.state = 'CLOSED'
    
    async def call(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.state == 'OPEN':
            if time.time() - self.last_failure_time > self.timeout:
                self.state = 'HALF_OPEN'
            else:
                raise CircuitBreakerOpenException("Service unavailable")
        
        try:
            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
            await self._on_success()
            return result
