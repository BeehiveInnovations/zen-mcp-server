"""
Test suite for conversation history bug fix

This test verifies that the critical bug where conversation history
(including file context) was not included when using continuation_id
has been properly fixed.

The bug was that tools with continuation_id would not see previous
conversation turns, causing issues like Gemini not seeing files that
Claude had shared in earlier turns.
