## Decision

**Documentation Structure**: Follow CLAUDE.md specified directory structure exactly
**Rationale**: User emphasized importance of following CLAUDE.md structure rather than creating custom organization
**Implementation Details**: Created docs/{user-guides,contributing,architecture,api} structure with specified files

**Docker Documentation Approach**: Emphasize automated Redis setup rather than manual configuration
**Rationale**: Analysis revealed Redis is fully automated through docker-compose.yml, previous docs were incorrect
**Implementation Details**: Rewrote installation guide to highlight "Everything is handled automatically - no manual Redis setup required!"

**Memory Bank Integration**: Implement file-based Memory Bank alongside Memory MCP server
**Rationale**: Dual-system approach for maximum context preservation and cross-session continuity
**Implementation Details**: Created initialization protocols, update triggers, and UMB command for comprehensive memory management

**GitHub Templates Strategy**: Create comprehensive templates matching CONTRIBUTING.md patterns
**Rationale**: Professional repository needs structured issue/PR workflows for contributors
**Implementation Details**: 4 YAML issue templates + markdown PR template with validation requirements
