Conversation Memory for AI-to-AI Multi-turn Discussions

This module provides conversation persistence and context reconstruction for
stateless MCP (Model Context Protocol) environments. It enables multi-turn
conversations between Claude and Gemini by storing conversation state in Redis
across independent request cycles.

ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW:
The MCP protocol is inherently stateless - each tool request is independent
with no memory of previous interactions. This module bridges that gap by:

1. Creating persistent conversation threads with unique UUIDs
2. Storing complete conversation context (turns, files, metadata) in Redis
3. Reconstructing conversation history when tools are called with continuation_id
4. Supporting cross-tool continuation - seamlessly switch between different tools
   while maintaining full conversation context and file references

CROSS-TOOL CONTINUATION:
A conversation started with one tool (e.g., 'analyze') can be continued with
any other tool (e.g., 'codereview', 'debug', 'chat') using the same continuation_id.
The second tool will have access to:
- All previous conversation turns and responses
- File context from previous tools (preserved in conversation history)
- Original thread metadata and timing information
- Accumulated knowledge from the entire conversation

Key Features:
- UUID-based conversation thread identification with security validation
- Turn-by-turn conversation history storage with tool attribution
- Cross-tool continuation support - switch tools while preserving context
- File context preservation - files shared in earlier turns remain accessible
- Automatic turn limiting (5 turns max) to prevent runaway conversations
- Context reconstruction for stateless request continuity
- Redis-based persistence with automatic expiration (1 hour TTL)
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent access
- Graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable

USAGE EXAMPLE:
1. Tool A creates thread: create_thread("analyze", request_data) → returns UUID
2. Tool A adds response: add_turn(UUID, "assistant", response, files=[...], tool_name="analyze")
3. Tool B continues thread: get_thread(UUID) → retrieves full context
4. Tool B sees conversation history via build_conversation_history()
5. Tool B adds its response: add_turn(UUID, "assistant", response, tool_name="codereview")

This enables true AI-to-AI collaboration across the entire tool ecosystem.
