Token counting utilities for managing API context limits

This module provides functions for estimating token counts to ensure
requests stay within the Gemini API's context window limits.

Note: The estimation uses a simple character-to-token ratio which is
approximate. For production systems requiring precise token counts,
consider using the actual tokenizer for the specific model.

    """
    Estimate token count using a character-based approximation.

    This uses a rough heuristic where 1 token â‰ˆ 4 characters, which is
    a reasonable approximation for English text. The actual token count
    may vary based on:
    - Language (non-English text may have different ratios)
    - Code vs prose (code often has more tokens per character)
    - Special characters and formatting
