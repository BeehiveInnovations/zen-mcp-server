## Why This Server?

Claude is brilliant, but sometimes you need:
- **A senior developer partner** to validate and extend ideas ([`chat`](#1-chat---general-development-chat--collaborative-thinking))
- **A second opinion** on complex architectural decisions - augment Claude's extended thinking with Gemini's perspective ([`think_deeper`](#2-think_deeper---extended-reasoning-partner))
- **Professional code reviews** with actionable feedback across entire repositories ([`review_code`](#3-review_code---professional-code-review))
- **Pre-commit validation** with deep analysis that finds edge cases, validates your implementation against original requirements, and catches subtle bugs Claude might miss ([`review_changes`](#4-review_changes---pre-commit-validation))
- **Expert debugging** for tricky issues with full system context ([`debug_issue`](#5-debug_issue---expert-debugging-assistant))
- **Massive context window** (1M tokens) - Gemini 2.5 Pro can analyze entire codebases, read hundreds of files at once, and provide comprehensive insights ([`analyze`](#6-analyze---smart-file-analysis))
- **Deep code analysis** across massive codebases that exceed Claude's context limits ([`analyze`](#6-analyze---smart-file-analysis))
- **Dynamic collaboration** - Gemini can request additional context from Claude mid-analysis for more thorough insights
- **Smart file handling** - Automatically expands directories, filters irrelevant files, and manages token limits when analyzing `"main.py, src/, tests/"`

This server makes Gemini your development sidekick, handling what Claude can't or extending what Claude starts.

**Prompt Used:**
```
Study the code properly, think deeply about what this does and then see if there's any room for improvement in
terms of performance optimizations, brainstorm with gemini on this to get feedback and then confirm any change by
first adding a unit test with `measure` and measuring current code and then implementing the optimization and
measuring again to ensure it improved, then share results. Check with gemini in between as you make tweaks.
```

## Quickstart (5 minutes)

### Prerequisites

Choose one of the following options:

**Option A: Docker (Recommended - No Python Required!)**
- Docker Desktop installed ([Download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- Git

**Option B: Traditional Setup**
- **Python 3.10 or higher** (required by the `mcp` package)
- Git

### 1. Get a Gemini API Key
Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) and generate an API key. For best results with Gemini 2.5 Pro, use a paid API key as the free tier has limited access to the latest models.

### 2. Clone and Set Up the Repository

```bash
# Clone to your preferred location
git clone https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/gemini-mcp-server.git
cd gemini-mcp-server
```

Now choose your setup method:

#### Option A: Docker Setup (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Generate the .env file with your current directory as workspace
# macOS/Linux:
./setup-docker-env.sh

# Windows (Command Prompt):
setup-docker-env.bat

# Windows (PowerShell):
.\setup-docker-env.ps1

# 2. Edit .env and add your Gemini API key
# The .env file will contain:
# WORKSPACE_ROOT=/your/current/directory  (automatically set)
# GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here  (you need to update this)

# 3. Build the Docker image
docker build -t gemini-mcp-server .
```

**That's it!** Docker handles all Python dependencies and environment setup for you.

#### Option B: Traditional Setup

```bash
# Run the setup script to install dependencies
# macOS/Linux:
./setup.sh

# Windows:
setup.bat
```

**Note the full path** - you'll need it in the next step:
- **macOS/Linux**: `/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/gemini-mcp-server`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\gemini-mcp-server`

**Important**: The setup script will:
- Create a Python virtual environment
- Install all required dependencies (mcp, google-genai, etc.)
- Verify your Python installation
- Provide next steps for configuration

If you encounter any issues during setup, see the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

### 3. Configure Claude Desktop
Add the server to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

**Find your config file:**
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`  
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**Or use Claude Desktop UI (macOS):**
- Open Claude Desktop
- Go to **Settings** → **Developer** → **Edit Config**

Choose your configuration based on your setup method:

#### Option A: Docker Configuration (Recommended)

**How it works:** Claude Desktop launches Docker, which runs the MCP server in a container. The communication happens through stdin/stdout, just like running a regular command.

**All Platforms (macOS/Linux/Windows):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gemini": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "--env-file", "/path/to/gemini-mcp-server/.env",
        "-v", "/path/to/your/project:/workspace:ro",
        "gemini-mcp-server:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important for Docker setup:**
- Replace `/path/to/gemini-mcp-server/.env` with the full path to your .env file
- Replace `/path/to/your/project` with the directory containing code you want to analyze
- The container runs temporarily when Claude needs it (no persistent Docker containers)
- Communication happens via stdio - Docker's `-i` flag connects the container's stdin/stdout to Claude

**Path Format Notes:**
- **Windows users**: Use forward slashes `/` in Docker paths (e.g., `C:/Users/john/project`)
- Docker on Windows automatically handles both forward slashes and backslashes
- The setup scripts generate the correct format for your platform

**Example for macOS/Linux:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gemini": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "--env-file", "/Users/john/gemini-mcp-server/.env",
        "-v", "/Users/john/my-project:/workspace:ro",
        "gemini-mcp-server:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Example for Windows:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gemini": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "--env-file", "C:/Users/john/gemini-mcp-server/.env",
        "-v", "C:/Users/john/my-project:/workspace:ro",
        "gemini-mcp-server:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option B: Traditional Configuration

**macOS/Linux:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gemini": {
      "command": "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/gemini-mcp-server/run_gemini.sh",
      "env": {
        "GEMINI_API_KEY": "your-gemini-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Windows (Native Python):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gemini": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\gemini-mcp-server\\run_gemini.bat",
      "env": {
        "GEMINI_API_KEY": "your-gemini-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Windows (Using WSL):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gemini": {
      "command": "wsl.exe",
      "args": ["/home/YOUR_WSL_USERNAME/gemini-mcp-server/run_gemini.sh"],
      "env": {
        "GEMINI_API_KEY": "your-gemini-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Restart Claude Desktop
Completely quit and restart Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect.

### 5. Connect to Claude Code

To use the server in Claude Code, run:
```bash
claude mcp add-from-claude-desktop -s user
```

### 6. Start Using It!

Just ask Claude naturally:
- "Use gemini to think deeper about this architecture design" → `think_deeper`
- "Get gemini to review this code for security issues" → `review_code`
- "Get gemini to debug why this test is failing" → `debug_issue`
- "Use gemini to analyze these files to understand the data flow" → `analyze`
- "Brainstorm with gemini about scaling strategies" → `chat`
- "Share my implementation plan with gemini for feedback" → `chat`
- "Get gemini's opinion on my authentication design" → `chat`

## Available Tools

**Quick Tool Selection Guide:**
- **Need a thinking partner?** → `chat` (brainstorm ideas, get second opinions, validate approaches)
- **Need deeper thinking?** → `think_deeper` (extends Claude's analysis, finds edge cases)
- **Code needs review?** → `review_code` (bugs, security, performance issues)
- **Pre-commit validation?** → `review_changes` (validate git changes before committing)
- **Something's broken?** → `debug_issue` (root cause analysis, error tracing)
- **Want to understand code?** → `analyze` (architecture, patterns, dependencies)
- **Server info?** → `get_version` (version and configuration details)

**Pro Tip:** You can control the depth of Gemini's analysis with thinking modes to manage token costs. For quick tasks use "minimal" or "low" to save tokens, for complex problems use "high" or "max" when quality matters more than cost. [Learn more about thinking modes](#thinking-modes---managing-token-costs--quality)

## Docker Setup (Recommended)

The Docker setup provides a consistent, hassle-free experience across all platforms without worrying about Python versions or dependencies.

### Why Docker?

- **Zero Python Setup**: No need to install Python or manage virtual environments
- **Consistent Environment**: Same behavior across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Easy Updates**: Just pull the latest image or rebuild
- **Isolated Dependencies**: No conflicts with your system Python packages

### Quick Setup Guide

The setup scripts do all the heavy lifting for you:

1. **Run the setup script for your platform:**
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux:
   ./setup-docker-env.sh
   
   # Windows (PowerShell):
   .\setup-docker-env.ps1
   
   # Windows (Command Prompt):
   setup-docker-env.bat
   ```

2. **The script will:**
   - Create a `.env` file with your current directory as the workspace
   - Display the exact Claude Desktop configuration to copy
   - Show you where to paste it

3. **Edit `.env` and add your Gemini API key**

4. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t gemini-mcp-server .
   ```

5. **Copy the configuration from step 1 into Claude Desktop**

That's it! The setup script generates everything you need.

### How It Works

- **Path Translation**: The server automatically translates file paths between your host and the container
- **Workspace Mounting**: Your project directory is mounted to `/workspace` inside the container
- **stdio Communication**: Docker's `-i` flag preserves the MCP communication channel

### Testing Your Setup

```bash
# Test that the server starts correctly
docker run --rm -i --env-file .env -v "$(pwd):/workspace:ro" gemini-mcp-server:latest

# You should see "INFO:__main__:Gemini API key found"
# Press Ctrl+C to exit
```

## Windows Setup Guide

### Option 1: Native Windows (Recommended)

For the smoothest experience on Windows, we recommend running the server natively:

1. **Install Python on Windows**
   - Download from [python.org](https://python.org) or install via Microsoft Store
   - Ensure Python 3.10 or higher

2. **Set up the project**
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\gemini-mcp-server
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Claude Desktop** using the Windows native configuration shown above

### Option 2: Using WSL (Advanced)

If you prefer to use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):

1. **Prerequisites**
   - WSL2 installed with a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu)
   - Python installed in your WSL environment
   - Project cloned inside WSL (recommended: `~/gemini-mcp-server`)

2. **Set up in WSL**
   ```bash
   # Inside WSL terminal
   cd ~/gemini-mcp-server
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   chmod +x run_gemini.sh
   ```

3. **Configure Claude Desktop** using the WSL configuration shown above

**Important WSL Notes:**
- For best performance, clone the repository inside WSL (`~/`) rather than on Windows (`/mnt/c/`)
- Ensure `run_gemini.sh` has Unix line endings (LF, not CRLF)
- If you have multiple WSL distributions, specify which one: `wsl.exe -d Ubuntu-22.04`

- `files`: Files or directories related to the issue
- `runtime_info`: Environment details
- `previous_attempts`: What you've tried
- `thinking_mode`: minimal|low|medium|high|max (default: medium)

```
"Use gemini to debug this error with context from the entire backend/ directory"
```

**`think_deeper`** - Extended analysis with file context
- `current_analysis`: Your current thinking (required)
- `problem_context`: Additional context
- `focus_areas`: Specific aspects to focus on
- `files`: Files or directories for context
- `thinking_mode`: minimal|low|medium|high|max (default: max)

```
"Use gemini to think deeper about my design with reference to the src/models/ directory"
```

## Collaborative Workflows

### Design → Review → Implement
```
"Design a real-time collaborative editor. Use gemini to think deeper about edge cases and scalability.
Implement an improved version incorporating gemini's suggestions."
```

### Code → Review → Fix
```
"Implement JWT authentication. Get gemini to do a security review. Fix any issues gemini identifies and
show me the secure implementation."
```

### Debug → Analyze → Solution
```
"Debug why our API crashes under load. Use gemini to analyze deeper with context from api/handlers/. Implement a
fix based on gemini's root cause analysis."
```

## Pro Tips

### Natural Language Triggers
The server recognizes natural phrases. Just talk normally:
- ❌ "Use the think_deeper tool with current_analysis parameter..."
- ✅ "Use gemini to think deeper about this approach"

### Automatic Tool Selection
Claude will automatically pick the right tool based on your request:
- "review" → `review_code`
- "debug" → `debug_issue`
- "analyze" → `analyze`
- "think deeper" → `think_deeper`

### Clean Terminal Output
All file operations use paths, not content, so your terminal stays readable even with large files.

### Context Awareness
Tools can reference files for additional context:
```
"Use gemini to debug this error with context from app.py and config.py"
"Get gemini to think deeper about my design, reference the current architecture.md"
```

### Tool Selection Guidance
To help choose the right tool for your needs:

**Decision Flow:**
1. **Have a specific error/exception?** → Use `debug_issue`
2. **Want to find bugs/issues in code?** → Use `review_code`
3. **Want to understand how code works?** → Use `analyze`
4. **Have analysis that needs extension/validation?** → Use `think_deeper`
5. **Want to brainstorm or discuss?** → Use `chat`

**Key Distinctions:**
- `analyze` vs `review_code`: analyze explains, review_code prescribes fixes
- `chat` vs `think_deeper`: chat is open-ended, think_deeper extends specific analysis
- `debug_issue` vs `review_code`: debug diagnoses runtime errors, review finds static issues

## Thinking Modes - Managing Token Costs & Quality

Control Gemini's reasoning depth to balance between response quality and token consumption. Each thinking mode uses a different amount of tokens, directly affecting API costs and response time.

### Thinking Modes & Token Budgets

| Mode | Token Budget | Use Case | Cost Impact |
|------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| `minimal` | 128 tokens | Simple, straightforward tasks | Lowest cost |
| `low` | 2,048 tokens | Basic reasoning tasks | 16x more than minimal |
| `medium` | 8,192 tokens | **Default** - Most development tasks | 64x more than minimal |
| `high` | 16,384 tokens | Complex problems requiring thorough analysis | 128x more than minimal |
| `max` | 32,768 tokens | Exhaustive reasoning (default for `think_deeper`) | 256x more than minimal |

### How to Use Thinking Modes

You can control thinking modes using natural language in your prompts. Remember: higher thinking modes = more tokens = higher cost but better quality:

#### Natural Language Examples

| Your Goal | Example Prompt |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Quick task** | "Use gemini to format this code with minimal thinking" |
| **Standard analysis** | "Get gemini to review auth.py" (uses default `medium`) |
| **Deep analysis** | "Use gemini to review this security module with high thinking mode" |
| **Maximum depth** | "Get gemini to think deeper with max thinking about this architecture" |
| **Compare approaches** | "First analyze this with low thinking, then again with high thinking" |

#### Optimizing Token Usage & Costs

**Use lower modes (`minimal`, `low`) to save tokens when:**
- Doing simple formatting or style checks
- Getting quick explanations of basic concepts
- Working with straightforward code
- You need faster responses
- Working within tight token budgets

**Use higher modes (`high`, `max`) when quality justifies the cost:**
- Debugging complex issues (worth the extra tokens to find root causes)
- Reviewing security-critical code (cost of tokens < cost of vulnerabilities)
- Analyzing system architecture (comprehensive analysis saves development time)
- Finding subtle bugs or edge cases
- Working on performance optimizations

**Token Cost Examples:**
- `minimal` (128 tokens) vs `max` (32,768 tokens) = 256x difference in thinking tokens
- For a simple formatting check, using `minimal` instead of the default `medium` saves ~8,000 thinking tokens
- For critical security reviews, the extra tokens in `high` or `max` mode are a worthwhile investment

**Examples by scenario:**
```
# Quick style check
"Use gemini to review formatting in utils.py with minimal thinking"

# Security audit
"Get gemini to do a security review of auth/ with thinking mode high"

# Complex debugging
"Use gemini to debug this race condition with max thinking mode"

# Architecture analysis
"Analyze the entire src/ directory architecture with high thinking"
```

## Advanced Features

### Dynamic Context Requests
Tools can request additional context from Claude during execution. When Gemini needs more information to provide a thorough analysis, it will ask Claude for specific files or clarification, enabling true collaborative problem-solving.

**Example:** If Gemini is debugging an error but needs to see a configuration file that wasn't initially provided, it can request: 
```json
{
  "status": "requires_clarification",
  "question": "I need to see the database configuration to understand this connection error",
  "files_needed": ["config/database.yml", "src/db_connection.py"]
}
```

Claude will then provide the requested files and Gemini can continue with a more complete analysis.

### Standardized Response Format
All tools now return structured JSON responses for consistent handling:
```json
{
  "status": "success|error|requires_clarification",
  "content": "The actual response content",
  "content_type": "text|markdown|json",
  "metadata": {"tool_name": "analyze", ...}
}
```

This enables better integration, error handling, and support for the dynamic context request feature.

## Configuration

The server includes several configurable properties that control its behavior:

### Model Configuration
- **`GEMINI_MODEL`**: `"gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05"` - The latest Gemini 2.5 Pro model with native thinking support
- **`MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS`**: `1,000,000` - Maximum input context (1M tokens for Gemini 2.5 Pro)

### Temperature Defaults
Different tools use optimized temperature settings:
- **`TEMPERATURE_ANALYTICAL`**: `0.2` - Used for code review and debugging (focused, deterministic)
- **`TEMPERATURE_BALANCED`**: `0.5` - Used for general chat (balanced creativity/accuracy)
- **`TEMPERATURE_CREATIVE`**: `0.7` - Used for deep thinking and architecture (more creative)


## File Path Requirements

**All file paths must be absolute paths.**

When using any Gemini tool, always provide absolute paths:
```
✅ "Use gemini to analyze /Users/you/project/src/main.py"
❌ "Use gemini to analyze ./src/main.py"  (will be rejected)
```

### Security & File Access

By default, the server allows access to files within your home directory. This is necessary for the server to work with any file you might want to analyze from Claude.

**To restrict access to a specific project directory**, set the `MCP_PROJECT_ROOT` environment variable:
```json
"env": {
  "GEMINI_API_KEY": "your-key",
  "MCP_PROJECT_ROOT": "/Users/you/specific-project"
}
```

This creates a sandbox limiting file access to only that directory and its subdirectories.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/gemini-mcp-server.git
   cd gemini-mcp-server
   ```

2. Create virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set your Gemini API key:
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

## How System Prompts Work

The server uses carefully crafted system prompts to give each tool specialized expertise:

### Prompt Architecture
- **Centralized Prompts**: All system prompts are defined in `prompts/tool_prompts.py`
- **Tool Integration**: Each tool inherits from `BaseTool` and implements `get_system_prompt()`
- **Prompt Flow**: `User Request → Tool Selection → System Prompt + Context → Gemini Response`

### Specialized Expertise
Each tool has a unique system prompt that defines its role and approach:
- **`think_deeper`**: Acts as a senior development partner, challenging assumptions and finding edge cases
- **`review_code`**: Expert code reviewer with security/performance focus, uses severity levels
- **`debug_issue`**: Systematic debugger providing root cause analysis and prevention strategies
- **`analyze`**: Code analyst focusing on architecture, patterns, and actionable insights

### Customization
To modify tool behavior, you can:
1. Edit prompts in `prompts/tool_prompts.py` for global changes
2. Override `get_system_prompt()` in a tool class for tool-specific changes
3. Use the `temperature` parameter to adjust response style (0.2 for focused, 0.7 for creative)

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! The modular architecture makes it easy to add new tools:

1. Create a new tool in `tools/`
2. Inherit from `BaseTool`
3. Implement required methods (including `get_system_prompt()`)
4. Add your system prompt to `prompts/tool_prompts.py`
5. Register your tool in `TOOLS` dict in `server.py`

See existing tools for examples.

## Testing

### Unit Tests (No API Key Required)
The project includes comprehensive unit tests that use mocks and don't require a Gemini API key:

```bash
# Run all unit tests
python -m pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/test_live_integration.py -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/test_live_integration.py --cov=. --cov-report=html
```

### Live Integration Tests (API Key Required)
To test actual API integration:

```bash
# Set your API key
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Run live integration tests
python tests/test_live_integration.py
```

### GitHub Actions CI/CD
The project includes GitHub Actions workflows that:

- **✅ Run unit tests automatically** - No API key needed, uses mocks
- **✅ Test on Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12** - Ensures compatibility
- **✅ Run linting and formatting checks** - Maintains code quality  
- **🔒 Run live tests only if API key is available** - Optional live verification

The CI pipeline works without any secrets and will pass all tests using mocked responses. Live integration tests only run if a `GEMINI_API_KEY` secret is configured in the repository.

## Troubleshooting

### Windows/WSL Issues

**Error: `spawn P:\path\to\run_gemini.bat ENOENT`**

This error occurs when Claude Desktop (running on Windows) can't properly execute the server. Common causes:

1. **Wrong execution environment**: You're trying to run WSL-based code from Windows
   - **Solution**: Use the WSL bridge configuration with `wsl.exe` (see Windows Setup Guide above)

2. **Path format mismatch**: Using Linux paths (`/mnt/c/...`) in Windows context
   - **Solution**: Use Windows paths for native execution, Linux paths only after `wsl.exe`

3. **Missing dependencies**: Python or required packages not installed in the execution environment
   - **Solution**: Ensure Python and dependencies are installed where you're trying to run (Windows or WSL)

**Testing your setup:**
- Windows users: Run `test_wsl_setup.bat` to verify your WSL configuration
- Check Python availability: `python --version` (Windows) or `wsl python3 --version` (WSL)

### Common Issues

**"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp'" or "No matching distribution found for mcp"**
- This means either:
  1. Python dependencies aren't installed - run the setup script
  2. Your Python version is too old - the `mcp` package requires Python 3.10+
- **Solution**: 
  - First check your Python version: `python3 --version` or `python --version`
  - If below 3.10, upgrade Python from https://python.org
  - Then run the setup script:
    - macOS/Linux: `./setup.sh` 
    - Windows: `setup.bat`
- If you still see this error, manually activate the virtual environment and install:
  ```bash
  # macOS/Linux:
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  
  # Windows:
  venv\Scripts\activate.bat
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

**"Virtual environment not found" warning**
- This is just a warning that can be ignored if dependencies are installed system-wide
- To fix: Run the setup script to create the virtual environment

**"GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable is required"**
- Ensure you've added your API key to the Claude Desktop configuration
- The key should be in the `env` section of your MCP server config

**"Connection failed" in Claude Desktop**
- Verify the command path is correct and uses proper escaping (`\\` for Windows paths)
- Ensure the script has execute permissions (Linux/macOS: `chmod +x run_gemini.sh`)
- Check Claude Desktop logs for detailed error messages

**Performance issues with WSL**
- Files on Windows drives (`/mnt/c/`) are slower to access from WSL
- For best performance, clone the repository inside WSL (`~/gemini-mcp-server`)
