Code Review tool - Comprehensive code analysis and review

This tool provides professional-grade code review capabilities using
Gemini's understanding of code patterns, best practices, and common issues.
It can analyze individual files or entire codebases, providing actionable
feedback categorized by severity.

Key Features:
- Multi-file and directory support
- Configurable review types (full, security, performance, quick)
- Severity-based issue filtering
- Custom focus areas and coding standards
- Structured output with specific remediation steps
