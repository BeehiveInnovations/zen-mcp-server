"""
AnalyzeWorkflow tool - Step-by-step code analysis with systematic investigation

This tool provides a structured workflow for comprehensive code and file analysis.
It guides the CLI agent through systematic investigation steps with forced pauses between each step
to ensure thorough code examination, pattern identification, and architectural assessment before proceeding.
The tool supports complex analysis scenarios including architectural review, performance analysis,
security assessment, and maintainability evaluation.

Key features:
- Step-by-step analysis workflow with progress tracking
- Context-aware file embedding (references during investigation, full content for analysis)
- Automatic pattern and insight tracking with categorization
- Expert analysis integration with external models
- Support for focused analysis (architecture, performance, security, quality)
- Confidence-based workflow optimization
